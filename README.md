## MPOX-HACKATHON---TEAM-BST
 
 #### Problem Statement: 
 Mpox is resurging as a serious public health challenge, hitting underserved communities the hardest. Weak infrastructure, poor surveillance sites, inadequate community health workers, and poor vaccine distribution make an effective response difficult. This project aims to tackle these gaps with evidence-based insights.

 


### Methodology

Data Source: African CDC and Zion Tech Hub



### Analytical Methods: 
The data was inspected for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies in data entry using Excel. After a thorough inspection, the data was found to be clean. In order to solve the problem statement, my team and I applied our critical thinking to generate questions in relation to the problem statement. We then proceeded to visualize the data to uncover insights. 



### Data Visualization Tools Used: 
Excel, Power BI



### Key Insights

Mpox continues to spread across 17 affected countries with 175,409 confirmed cases and 5,836 deaths, underscoring a critical public health threat. While over 916,701 vaccines have been deployed out of 1,074,875 allocated, disparities remain between vaccine supply, surveillance coverage, and confirmed case burden. Notably, out of the 17 countries, Burundi, Sierra Leone, and Uganda have emerged as high-burden hotspots, yet their response capacity in terms of laboratories, community health workers, and vaccines administered is not aligned with the scale of the outbreak.



### Recommendations

Prioritize High Burden Countries and maintain the health system of other countries by:

1) Reallocation and urgent expansion of surveillance sites: scaling to 500-700 sites could raise early detection by 40 -96%

2) Strengthen diagnostic capacity: Expanding to 200- 500 labs would reduce the load to just 74 cases per lab, cutting diagnostic delays and enabling faster contact tracing.

3) Strengthen frontline response: by expanding the number of community health workers
